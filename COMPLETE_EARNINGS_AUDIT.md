## 💰 THE ECONOMICS THAT WILL SCALE

### Monthly Unit Economics (10,000 Users)
```
Revenue Sources:
- Marketing Firms: 100 × $500 = $50,000
- Hedge Funds: 10 × $5,000 = $50,000  
- Small Business: 500 × $99 = $50,000
Total Revenue: $150,000/month

User Payouts:
- Learning (6,000): $6/user = $36,000
- Verified (1,500): $12/user = $18,000
- Elite (500): $20/user = $10,000
- Master (100): $30/user = $3,000
Total Payouts: $67,000/month (45%)

Gross Margin: 55% = $83,000/month
```

### Path to $10M ARR
| Year | Users | Revenue | User Payouts | Margin |
|------|-------|---------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | 5,000 | $1M | $400k | 60% |
| 2 | 10,000 | $3M | $1.2M | 60% |
| 3 | 25,000 | $10M | $4M | 60% |
