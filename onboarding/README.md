## The Uber Model Implementation

This directory contains the complete onboarding copy implementing the Uber driver analogy for WaveSight's quality control system.

## Files Created

### 3. `warning-system-documentation.md`

## Key Concepts Implemented

### The Uber Parallel
- **Uber:** Bad drivers → Low ratings → Deactivated
- **WaveSight:** Bad analysts → Low accuracy → Lose access

### Quality Thresholds (Like Uber's 4.6 Star Requirement)
- 90%+ = Elite status (max earnings)
- 80-89% = Good standing (multipliers active)
- 70-79% = Warning zone
- Below 70% = Tier loss
- Below 60% = Deactivation risk

### Self-Cleaning Ecosystem
- Bad analysts quit because low pay makes it not worth their time
- Good analysts thrive with higher tiers and multipliers
- Platform maintains quality automatically

### Progressive Warning System
1. **First Warning (75%):** Educational support
2. **Second Warning (70%):** Mandatory training
3. **Probation (65%):** Tier demotion, limited privileges
4. **Deactivation (<65%):** Account suspension

## Implementation Notes

### Tone & Messaging
- Professional but fair
- Clear consequences without being harsh
- Emphasizes earning potential for quality

### Key Messages
- "This is professional intelligence work, not social media"

## The Result

A self-regulating platform where:
- Quality is non-negotiable

- Bad analysts self-select out
- Enterprise clients receive reliable intelligence
- Platform scales without manual oversight

**The Uber model works because it aligns incentives: maintain professional standards or lose access to the platform.**
