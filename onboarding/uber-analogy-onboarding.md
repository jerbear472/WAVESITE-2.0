# WaveSight Cultural Analyst Onboarding
## The Uber Model for Cultural Intelligence

### Welcome Screen

**Welcome to WaveSight**

Think of this like becoming an Uber driver, but for cultural intelligence.

Good drivers earn more and get better rides.  
Bad drivers get deactivated.

Same here: Quality analysts thrive. Spam submitters get removed.

### The Professional Standards

**Your Accuracy Score = Your Driver Rating**

Just like Uber drivers need 4.6+ stars to stay active, you need:

‚Ä¢ **90%+ accuracy** = Elite status (earn up to $4.69/trend)  
‚Ä¢ **80-90% accuracy** = Good standing (multipliers active)  
‚Ä¢ **70-80% accuracy** = ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning zone  
‚Ä¢ **Below 70%** = Tier loss, reduced earnings  
‚Ä¢ **Below 60%** = Account deactivation risk

**This isn't harsh - it's fair.** Bad trends hurt everyone's earnings.

### What Quality Looks Like

**Would you want this driver?**

‚ùå **1-Star Driver:** Shows up late, dirty car, takes wrong route  
‚ùå **1-Star Analyst:** "funny video trending lol"

‚úÖ **5-Star Driver:** Clean car, knows the city, professional  
‚úÖ **5-Star Analyst:** "Gen Z abandoning Shein after factory documentary"

**The difference?** One provides professional service. The other wastes everyone's time.

Your submissions appear on Fortune 500 dashboards. Act like it.

### Your Accuracy Score

**Every trend you submit gets rated by 3 peer analysts**

‚Ä¢ **3 approvals** = You nailed it  
‚Ä¢ **2 approvals** = Good enough  
‚Ä¢ **1 approval** = Questionable quality  
‚Ä¢ **0 approvals** = Rejected (hurts your score)

Just like passengers rate drivers after each ride.

**Your last 50 submissions = Your accuracy score**

‚Ä¢ Stay above 80% to keep growing  
‚Ä¢ Fall below 70% = Lose privileges
