Just like Uber, quality isn't negotiable. Here's exactly what we're looking for:

**Why this hurts your score:**

## The Quality Checklist

### Before You Submit, Ask:

**1. The CEO Test**
> "Would a Fortune 500 CEO pay $50 to know this information?"

If the answer is no, don't submit it.

**2. The Specificity Test**
> "Can I identify exactly who is doing this and where?"

Vague demographics = rejected submission.

**3. The Evidence Test**
> "Do I have measurable proof this is happening?"

"I saw it somewhere" isn't evidence.

**4. The Business Impact Test**
> "What specific business decisions could this inform?"

If you can't name 2 business implications, it's not ready.

**5. The Professional Test**
> "Would I present this in a boardroom?"

Grammar, spelling, and professional tone matter.

## The Bottom Line

This isn't a game. It's not "easy money." It's professional intelligence work.

**Like Uber:** Maintain your rating or lose access.

**Unlike Uber:** The earning potential has no ceiling for top performers.

**Your choice:** Professional standards and real money, or spam submissions and deactivation.

**The platform works because we maintain standards.**

**Help us keep it that way.**
