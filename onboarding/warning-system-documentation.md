# Warning System Documentation
## The Uber-Style Quality Control System

### The Fair But Firm Approach

Just like Uber gives drivers multiple chances to improve before deactivation, WaveSight uses a progressive warning system that protects both analysts and platform quality.

## The Rehabilitation System

### Second Chances (But Not Third)

**The Philosophy:** Everyone deserves a chance to improve, but chronic poor performance hurts everyone.

### Warning Progression Timeline

**Week 1-2:** Learn the platform, build accuracy
**Week 3:** First warning possible - educational support
**Week 4:** Second warning possible - mandatory improvement
**Week 5:** Final warning possible - probation status
**Week 6+:** Deactivation risk for continued poor performance

### Recovery Speed

**From First Warning:**
- 5 good submissions → Warning cleared
- ~3-5 days for active analysts

**From Second Warning:**
- Training completion + 10 good submissions
- ~1-2 weeks for dedicated improvement

**From Probation:**
- Full training + 15 submissions at 80%+
- 2-3 weeks intensive focus required

### The Motivation Curve

**Early Success:** High motivation, learning curve forgiveness
**First Warning:** Educational nudge, maintain motivation
**Second Warning:** Serious intervention, last easy chance
**Probation:** Final opportunity, significant effort required
**Deactivation:** Natural selection completed

---

## Special Circumstances

### New Analyst Grace Period

**First 25 Submissions:** Warnings issued but no tier demotion
**Rationale:** Learning curve recognition
**Requirement:** Must show improvement trend

### Veteran Analyst Consideration

**200+ Submissions:** Longer improvement periods
**Master Tier:** Manual review before deactivation
**Rationale:** Proven track record earns extra chances

### Appeal Process

**Valid Appeal Reasons:**
- System errors in validation
- Coordinated malicious peer reviews
- Technical submission problems
- Miscategorized demographic trends

**Invalid Appeal Reasons:**
- "I thought it was good"
- "Other people submit worse"
- "The peers don't understand"
- General disagreement with quality standards

---

## Why This System Works

### Self-Regulating Quality

**Bad Analysts Self-Select Out:**
- Week 1: Submit garbage → Low accuracy → $0.25 per trend
- Week 2: Still garbage → Warning zone → Making $20/week

**Good Analysts Thrive:**
- Week 1: Quality submissions → 85% accuracy → Verified tier
- Week 2: 1.5x multiplier + streaks → Making $150/week
- Week 3: Elite tier approaching → Motivated to maintain quality
