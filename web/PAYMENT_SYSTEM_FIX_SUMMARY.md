# Payment System Fix Summary

## Overview
Fixed critical payment system bugs for the Wavesight trend tracking app launch. The payment structure now properly implements the earnings formula and validation thresholds.

## Changes Made

### 1. Earnings Formula for Trend Submissions
The earnings formula is now correctly implemented as:
```
Earnings = Base × Tier Multiplier × Daily Streak × Session Streak
```

- **Base rate**: $0.25 per trend submission
- **Tier multipliers**: 
  - Master: 3.0x
  - Elite: 2.0x  
  - Verified: 1.5x
  - Learning: 1.0x
  - Restricted: 0.5x
- **Daily streak multipliers**:
  - 30+ days: 2.5x
  - 14-29 days: 2.0x
  - 7-13 days: 1.5x
  - 2-6 days: 1.2x
  - 0-1 days: 1.0x
- **Session streak multipliers** (rapid submissions within 5 minutes):
  - 1st submission: 1.0x
  - 2nd submission: 1.2x
  - 3rd submission: 1.5x
  - 4th submission: 2.0x
  - 5+ submissions: 2.5x

Maximum possible earnings per trend: **$5.00** (capped - theoretical would be $4.69: $0.25 × 3.0x × 2.5x × 2.5x)

### 2. Validation System
- **Validation threshold**: Changed to require **3 approve votes** or **3 reject votes**
- **Validation earnings**: Fixed at **$0.02 per validation** (immediate payout to approved earnings)
- Trend submitters earn the pending amount only after 3 approve votes
- If a trend gets 3 reject votes first, the pending earnings are cancelled

### 3. Earnings Display
Created a new `EarningsNotification` component that:
- Appears in the **bottom left corner** when users earn money
- Shows the amount earned with a breakdown of multipliers
- Auto-dismisses after 8 seconds
- Different colors for different earning types:
  - Blue/Purple for trend submissions (pending)
  - Green for validations (immediate)
  - Yellow/Orange for approved trends
  - Gray for rejected trends

### 4. Implementation Details

#### Files Modified:
1. `/app/(authenticated)/submit/page.tsx`
   - Integrated earnings notification
   - Fixed earnings calculation to use UNIFIED_EARNINGS
   - Added streak data fetching from user profile
   - Shows proper earnings breakdown

2. `/app/(authenticated)/validate/page.tsx`
   - Fixed validation earnings to $0.02 flat rate
   - Changed earnings status to 'approved' for immediate payout
   - Integrated earnings notification

3. `/components/EarningsNotification.tsx` (NEW)
   - Custom notification component for earnings
   - Animated appearance in bottom left
   - Shows amount, type, and breakdown

4. `/lib/UNIFIED_EARNINGS.ts`
   - Already had correct formulas
   - Used as single source of truth

5. `/lib/SUSTAINABLE_EARNINGS.ts`
   - Validation vote already set to $0.02
   - Validation threshold already set to 3 votes

### 5. User Flow

#### For Trend Submission:
1. User submits a trend
2. Earnings calculated: base × tier × daily_streak × session_streak
3. Amount shows in bottom left notification
4. Earnings marked as "pending" in database
5. After 3 approve votes → earnings move to "approved"
6. After 3 reject votes → earnings cancelled

#### For Validation:
1. User validates a trend (approve/reject)
2. Immediately earns $0.02
3. Amount shows in bottom left notification
4. Earnings marked as "approved" in database (immediate payout)
