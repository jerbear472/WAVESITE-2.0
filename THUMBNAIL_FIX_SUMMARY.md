# TikTok Thumbnail Extraction Fix Summary

## Problem
TikTok thumbnail extraction was failing due to CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions when trying to load TikTok CDN images directly in the browser.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Image Proxy Route (`/api/proxy-image`)
- Created a server-side proxy that fetches images and serves them with proper CORS headers
- Handles failures gracefully with placeholder images
- Location: `web/app/api/proxy-image/route.ts`

### 2. Updated Ultra Simple Thumbnail Extractor
- Modified to return proxied URLs for TikTok videos
- Extracts video ID from TikTok URLs
- Generates proxied thumbnail URLs that work in browsers
- Location: `web/lib/ultraSimpleThumbnail.ts`

### 3. Enhanced Form with API Fallback
- Primary: Uses simple extractor (now with proxied URLs)
- Fallback: Calls `/api/tiktok-thumbnail` if simple extraction fails
- Always proxies TikTok thumbnails to avoid CORS issues
- Location: `web/components/TrendSubmissionFormEnhanced.tsx`

## How It Works

1. User pastes TikTok URL (e.g., `https://www.tiktok.com/@username/video/123456789`)
2. Simple extractor extracts video ID and generates proxied URL: `/api/proxy-image?url={encoded_cdn_url}`
3. If that fails, API route tries alternative methods (oEmbed, etc.)
4. Proxy route fetches the image server-side and serves it to the browser
5. Thumbnail is saved with the trend submission

## Testing

### Test Page
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/test-tiktok-thumbnail
- Paste any TikTok URL to test extraction
- Shows both direct load (will fail) and proxied load (will work)

### Main Submission Flow
- Visit: http://localhost:3000/submit
- Paste TikTok URL
- Thumbnail will be automatically extracted and displayed
- Check browser console for extraction logs

## Key Files Modified
- `web/lib/ultraSimpleThumbnail.ts` - Returns proxied URLs
- `web/components/TrendSubmissionFormEnhanced.tsx` - Uses proxy for thumbnails
- `web/app/api/proxy-image/route.ts` - New proxy endpoint
- `web/app/api/tiktok-thumbnail/route.ts` - Existing API for extraction
- `web/app/test-tiktok-thumbnail/page.tsx` - Test page for verification

## Benefits
- ✅ Thumbnails now load reliably for TikTok videos
- ✅ No CORS errors in browser
- ✅ Fallback mechanisms for resilience
- ✅ Works with all TikTok video URLs that have video IDs
- ✅ Graceful degradation with placeholder images
