SCROLL SESSION FIX SUMMARY
=============================================

The issue with stopping scroll sessions has been fixed. The following changes were made:

1. SessionContext.tsx:
   - Added proper timer cleanup in endSession() function
   - Now explicitly clears the interval timer when ending a session
   - Ensures localStorage is properly updated with the ended session state
   - Fixed state management to properly reset all session properties

2. spot/page.tsx:
   - Updated the End Session button to properly handle async endSession() call
   - Changed onClick handler to use async/await pattern

3. FloatingSessionTimer.tsx:
   - Updated End button to handle async endSession() call
   - Updated minimized view button to handle async properly

4. test-session/page.tsx:
   - Updated test page button to handle async endSession() call

KEY FIXES:
---------
✅ Timer is now properly cleared when session ends
✅ localStorage is explicitly updated to persist session state
✅ All buttons properly await the async endSession() function
✅ Session state is correctly reset (isActive: false, duration: 0, etc.)

HOW TO TEST:
-----------
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/spot
2. Click "Start" to begin a scroll session
3. Let it run for a few seconds
4. Click "End" to stop the session
5. The session should properly stop and reset

The session should now:
- Stop immediately when End is clicked
- Clear the timer display
- Reset to "Start" state
- Persist the stopped state even after page refresh
