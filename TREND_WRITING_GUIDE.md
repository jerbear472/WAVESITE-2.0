# Trend Writing Guide - Write Headlines That Earn More! üìà

## Overview
We've added an AI-powered trend writing helper to help users write high-quality, headline-style trend submissions that get noticed and earn more rewards.

## Key Features

### 1. Real-Time Quality Score
- **Instant feedback** as users type their trend titles
- **Quality score from 0-100%** based on:
  - Strong action verbs (exploding, surging, viral)
  - Specific demographics (Gen Z, retail investors, whales)
  - Metrics and numbers (50%, 10x growth)
  - Platform specificity (TikTok, Reddit, Discord)
  - Urgency indicators (overnight, suddenly, quietly)

### 2. Category-Specific Templates
Templates and examples for each trend category:
- **Finance & Stocks**: "Retail investors are piling into [stock]"
- **Gaming & Tech**: "Gaming community going crazy over [trend]"
- **Fashion & Lifestyle**: "Gen Z bringing back [trend] in unexpected way"
- **Food & Health**: "Ancient [practice] becoming luxury status symbol"
- **Entertainment**: "K-pop stans organizing to [action]"

### 3. High-Performing Examples

- ‚úÖ "Gaming community going crazy over AI-generated RPG"
- ‚úÖ "Gen Z discovers dividend investing through TikTok"

### 4. What to Avoid
- ‚ùå Vague terms (thing, stuff, something)

- ‚ùå Starting with "The" or "A"
