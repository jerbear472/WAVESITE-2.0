## 📊 SUMMARY OF INCONSISTENCIES

### Critical Issues:
1. **Tier Multipliers**: 3 different systems with conflicting values
   - Elite: Shows as 2.0x OR 1.5x depending on file
   - Verified: Shows as 1.5x OR 1.0x depending on file
   - Learning: Shows as 1.0x OR 0.7x depending on file
   - Restricted: Shows as 0.5x OR 0.3x depending on file

2. **Tier Names**: Different systems use different tier names
   - System 1: master/elite/verified/learning/restricted
   - System 2: Same names but different values
   - System 3: premium/standard/probation/suspended

### Minor Issues:
1. Validation rate was $0.02 in Python (now fixed to $0.10)
2. Category multipliers exist but aren't used
3. Validation accuracy multipliers exist but aren't integrated

## 🔧 REQUIRED FIXES

1. **Update all SQL migrations** to use the unified tier multipliers
2. **Remove or archive** the old 4-tier system
3. **Update documentation** to reflect the single standard
4. **Add validation** to prevent future inconsistencies
5. **Create single source of truth** configuration file
