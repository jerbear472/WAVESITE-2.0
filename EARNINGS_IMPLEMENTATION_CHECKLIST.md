## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Tasks

### 1. Database Migration
- [ ] **Execute migration** in development environment
  ```bash
  supabase migration up
  ```
- [ ] **Verify column additions** worked correctly
- [ ] **Test trigger functions** for automatic calculations
- [ ] **Audit existing data** for inconsistencies

### 2. Additional Frontend Components
- [ ] Update `/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/page.tsx`
- [ ] Update `/app/(authenticated)/timeline/page.tsx`
- [ ] Update `/app/(authenticated)/earnings/page.tsx`
- [ ] Update `/components/CashOutModal.tsx`
- [ ] Update `/components/PaymentHistory.tsx`
- [ ] Update `/components/SubmissionHistory.tsx`
- [ ] Update `/components/TrendTile.tsx`

### 3. Mobile App Updates
- [ ] Update `/mobile/src/screens/ValidationScreenUpdated.tsx`
- [ ] Update `/mobile/src/screens/DashboardScreenClean.tsx`
- [ ] Update `/mobile/src/screens/EarningsDashboard.tsx`
- [ ] Create mobile version of `EARNINGS_STANDARD.ts`

### 4. Backend API Updates
- [ ] Update `/backend/app/api/v1/trends.py` to use `earnings_standard.py`
- [ ] Update `/backend/app/api/v1/trend_validations.py`
- [ ] Update `/backend/app/services/payment_calculator.py` to import from standard
- [ ] Add earnings validation endpoint

### 5. Testing Requirements

#### Unit Tests Needed
- [ ] Test `calculateTrendSubmissionEarnings()` with all bonus combinations
- [ ] Test tier multipliers (0.3x to 1.5x)
- [ ] Test streak multipliers (1.0x to 3.0x)
- [ ] Test earning caps ($3.00 per submission, $50.00 daily)
- [ ] Test validation earnings calculations

#### Integration Tests Needed
- [ ] Test trend submission ‚Üí database ‚Üí earnings calculation flow
- [ ] Test validation ‚Üí approval ‚Üí bonus payment flow
- [ ] Test cashout eligibility ($5.00 minimum)
- [ ] Test daily earning limits

#### End-to-End Tests
- [ ] Submit trend with all bonuses ‚Üí verify correct earning
- [ ] Complete validation session ‚Üí verify correct payment
- [ ] Trend approval flow ‚Üí verify approval bonus

### 6. Data Migration & Cleanup
- [ ] **Recalculate historical earnings** to match new standard
  ```sql
  -- Audit current earnings
  SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(total_earned) 
  FROM trend_submissions 
  WHERE total_earned != base_amount + bonus_amount;
  ```
- [ ] **Fix any data inconsistencies**
- [ ] **Update user balances** if needed
- [ ] **Create rollback plan** in case of issues

### 7. Monitoring & Validation
- [ ] Add logging for earning calculations
- [ ] Create admin dashboard for earning audits
- [ ] Set up alerts for:
  - Earnings exceeding caps
  - Calculation mismatches
  - Failed payment processing
- [ ] Create daily reconciliation job

### 8. Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update API documentation with new earning structure
- [ ] Update user-facing help docs
- [ ] Create earning calculation examples
- [ ] Document rollback procedures

### 9. Deployment Strategy
1. **Stage 1: Development**
   - [ ] Run migration
   - [ ] Deploy code updates
   - [ ] Run tests

2. **Stage 2: Staging**
   - [ ] Test with production-like data
   - [ ] Verify calculations match expected
   - [ ] Load test earning calculations

3. **Stage 3: Production**
   - [ ] Deploy during low-traffic window
   - [ ] Monitor for calculation errors
   - [ ] Be ready to rollback if needed

## üö® Critical Validation Checks

Before going live, verify:
- [ ] All components use EARNINGS_STANDARD
- [ ] No hardcoded earning values remain
- [ ] Database triggers match TypeScript calculations
- [ ] API responses include all required earning fields
- [ ] Mobile app calculations match web
- [ ] Historical data has been migrated correctly

## üìä Success Metrics

Track after deployment:
- Average earnings per submission (should be ~$1.20-1.50)
- Daily cap hit frequency (should be rare)
- Validation earning accuracy (exactly $0.10 √ó tier multiplier)
- Approval bonus payment rate
- User complaints about earning discrepancies

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert code deployment
2. Restore database from backup
3. Recalculate affected earnings
4. Communicate with affected users
5. Deploy fixes and re-attempt
