✅ Session is optional for tracking progress
✅ Clear Start/End controls with visual feedback

✅ Uses `Linking.openURL()` to launch platform apps/browsers
✅ Each platform has its trending/for-you page URL

### UI/UX Consistency
✅ Clean white cards with subtle shadows
✅ Gradient accents for important elements
✅ Clear typography hierarchy
✅ Responsive layout adapting to screen size
✅ Color scheme matching web app (purples, greens, blues)

## 📱 Navigation Updates

### MainNavigator Changes
- Replaced `TrendSpotterScreen` with `ScrollScreen`
- Updated tab type from 'spot' to 'scroll'
- Changed tab icon to 📱 (mobile phone emoji)
- Tab label now shows "Scroll" instead of "Spot"

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   npm run ios   # For iOS
   npm run android   # For Android
   ```

2. **Navigate to Scroll tab** (first tab in bottom navigation)

3. **Browse platforms**:
   - Tap any platform button to open it
   - Platforms open in external browser/app

4. **Submit trends**:
   - Paste URL in the input field
   - Click "Start Submission" to begin process
   - Form will open for detailed submission

5. **Track sessions** (optional):
   - Click "Start" to begin session tracking
   - Watch streak counter and multipliers
   - Click "End" when done browsing

## 🎨 Design Decisions

1. **No Auto-Session**: Matches web app - sessions are user-initiated
2. **External Links**: Platforms open externally, not embedded
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important actions (submit, session) are prominent
4. **Mobile-First**: Touch-friendly targets, appropriate spacing
5. **Performance**: Lightweight components, efficient re-renders

## 📝 Notes

- The ScrollScreen is now the primary entry point for trend submission
- Session tracking is completely optional
- Platform links open in user's preferred apps when available
- All earnings calculations match the web app's logic
- The UI closely mirrors the web app while being optimized for mobile

## 🔄 Future Enhancements
