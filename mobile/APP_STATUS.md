# WaveSight Mobile App Status

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. User Profile Error (FIXED)
- **Issue**: "Cannot coerce the result to a single JSON object" when fetching user profile
- **Solution**: Changed `.single()` to `.maybeSingle()` in `getUserProfile` function
- **Location**: `src/services/supabaseService.ts:107`
- **Additional Fix**: Added automatic profile creation for new users

### 2. Dependency Conflicts (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: TensorFlow.js React Native incompatible with React 18
- **Solution**: Removed unused TensorFlow dependencies from package.json
- **Status**: Dependencies now install successfully with `--legacy-peer-deps`

### 3. Missing Type Definitions (PATCHED)
- **Issue**: Multiple TypeScript errors for missing module declarations
- **Solution**: Created type declaration files for third-party modules
- **Location**: `src/types/modules.d.ts`
