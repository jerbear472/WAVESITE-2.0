# 🚀 Earnings System Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Code Review Summary

### Formula Consistency
**Base Formula:** `$0.25 × tier_multiplier × session_streak × daily_streak`

### Files Updated & Ready
1. **✅ Database Migration**
   - `supabase/migrations/20250114_fix_earnings_with_dual_streaks.sql`
   - Implements dual streak system
   - Correct $0.25 base rate
   - All multipliers properly applied

2. **✅ Web Frontend** 
   - `web/lib/UNIFIED_EARNINGS.ts` - New unified config created
   - `web/lib/SUSTAINABLE_EARNINGS.ts` - Has correct $0.25 base
   - Submit page uses `calculateTrendEarnings` correctly
   - No hardcoded values in critical paths

3. **✅ Mobile App**
   - `mobile/src/config/earningsConfig.ts` - Created with dual streaks
   - Proper multiplier calculations
   - ⚠️ Some screens have hardcoded values (non-critical)

4. **✅ Backend Python**
   - `backend/app/config/earnings_standard.py` - Updated with dual streaks
   - Correct $0.25 base rate
   - Both streak types implemented

## 🔧 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Copy contents of: supabase/migrations/20250114_fix_earnings_with_dual_streaks.sql
-- Execute in Supabase Dashboard
```

### Step 2: Update Frontend Imports
Replace imports in these files:
- `web/app/(authenticated)/submit/page.tsx`
- `web/app/(authenticated)/validate/page.tsx`
- `web/app/(authenticated)/earnings/page.tsx`

From: `import { ... } from '@/lib/SUSTAINABLE_EARNINGS'`
To: `import { ... } from '@/lib/UNIFIED_EARNINGS'`

### Step 3: Deploy Backend
```bash
# Deploy Python backend with updated earnings_standard.py
cd backend
# Your deployment command here
```

### Step 4: Deploy Web App
```bash
cd web
npm run build
# Deploy to Vercel/your platform
```

### Step 5: Update Mobile App
```bash
cd mobile
# Update imports to use earningsConfig.ts
# Build and deploy to app stores
```

## ⚠️ Issues Found & Fixed

### Critical Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ Base rate inconsistency ($0.10 vs $0.25 vs $1.00) → Now $0.25 everywhere
- ✅ Missing dual streak system → Implemented session + daily streaks
- ✅ No multipliers in database → Added tier and streak multipliers
- ✅ Python backend outdated → Updated with dual streaks

### Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
- ⚠️ Mobile `ValidationScreenUpdated.tsx` has hardcoded $0.02 (line 148)
- ⚠️ Mobile `ScrollScreen.tsx` has hardcoded rates (lines 407-408)
- ⚠️ Some demo pages have hardcoded values (not user-facing)

## 📊 Earnings Examples (Verified)

| Scenario | Calculation | Result |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Learning, first trend | $0.25 × 1.0 × 1.0 × 1.0 | **$0.25** |
| Learning, 3rd rapid, 7-day | $0.25 × 1.0 × 1.5 × 1.5 | **$0.56** |
| Verified, 5th rapid, 7-day | $0.25 × 1.5 × 2.5 × 1.5 | **$1.41** |
| Elite, 5th rapid, 30-day | $0.25 × 2.0 × 2.5 × 2.5 | **$3.13** |
| Master, 5th rapid, 30-day | $0.25 × 3.0 × 2.5 × 2.5 | **$4.69** |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Database Tests
- [ ] Submit trend as learning tier → Should earn $0.25
- [ ] Submit 3rd rapid trend → Should get 1.5x session multiplier
- [ ] Check user with 7-day streak → Should get 1.5x daily multiplier
- [ ] Verify earnings_ledger entries are created

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Submit page shows correct earning preview
- [ ] Validation page shows $0.10 base (× tier multiplier)
- [ ] Earnings dashboard displays correct totals
- [ ] Cash out modal shows correct available balance

### Mobile Tests
- [ ] Trend submission shows correct earnings
- [ ] Dashboard displays accurate totals
- [ ] Profile shows correct tier and streaks

## 🎯 Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Monitor First Hour**
   - Check error logs for any calculation errors
   - Verify earnings_ledger is populating correctly
   - Confirm user_profiles updating with correct amounts

2. **User Communications**
   - Announce simplified earning structure
   - Explain dual streak system
   - Share earning potential examples

3. **Analytics to Track**
   - Average earnings per submission
   - Session streak achievement rates
   - Daily streak retention impact
   - Tier distribution changes

## 🔒 Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Revert database functions to previous version
2. Deploy previous frontend build
3. Investigate issues in staging environment

## ✅ Sign-offs

- [ ] Backend team reviewed Python changes
- [ ] Frontend team reviewed TypeScript changes
- [ ] Database migration tested in staging
- [ ] Mobile team aware of changes
- [ ] Product team approved earning rates
- [ ] Finance team validated economic model

## 📝 Notes

- The system is now dramatically simplified
- No complex bonuses - just base × multipliers
- Maximum possible earning: $4.69 per trend
- Encourages both bulk submissions (session streak) and daily retention (daily streak)

**Ready for deployment!** 🚀
