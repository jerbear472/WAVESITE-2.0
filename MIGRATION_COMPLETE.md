## Next Development Steps

1. **Implement approval bonus logic** - Automatically pay $0.50 when trends reach approval threshold
2. **Add streak tracking** - Implement daily submission streaks for multipliers
3. **Create tier progression** - Move users from learning â†’ verified â†’ elite based on performance
4. **Add cashout functionality** - Connect to payment providers
5. **Implement scroll earnings** - Pay users for scroll session participation

## Important Files

- `EARNINGS_STANDARD.ts` - Core earning configuration
- `FRESH_START_SCHEMA.sql` - Database structure
- `FINAL_RLS_FIX.sql` - Security policies (already applied)
- `.env` - Environment variables (keep secure!)

## Support

The application is fully functional. You can now:
1. Create users
2. Submit trends
3. Validate submissions
4. Track earnings

All numeric overflow and database issues have been resolved through the fresh start approach.
